# 🚧 **Build Instructions** 🚧

Getting **nameShifter** ready to rock is like brewing your favorite coffee - it requires specific steps but the end result is oh-so satisfying. Follow these brewing... I mean, building instructions to get started on both Windows and Unix systems. 🛠️☕

### For Windows Warriors 🪖💻

1. Open your command prompt with a flick of your wrist or a click of your mouse. Feel the power!
2. Navigate to the root directory of **nameShifter** where the mystical `build.bat` script resides.
3. Summon the build script with the ancient incantation:

```bash
.\build.bat
```

Watch as the console comes alive, compiling and concocting your tool into existence. It's like magic, but cooler because it's code. 🧙‍♂️💾

### For Unix Heroes 🦸‍♀️🐧

1. Open your terminal. You can pretend it's a portal to another dimension if you like - we won't judge.
2. Trek through the filesystem to the sacred land of **nameShifter**'s base camp, where `build.sh` has been waiting for centuries (or since you cloned the repo).
3. With the courage of a thousand penguins, execute the revered script:

```zsh
./build.sh
```

Behold as the script weaves its spells, stitching together binaries and libraries with the elegance of a master craftsman. Or craftswoman. Or craftsperson. You get the idea. 🧵✨
